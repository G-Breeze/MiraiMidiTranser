# Midi2Midercode
将midi格式文件转为 midercode

# Usage 
```java
String path = "midi-path";
var seq = MidiSystem.getSequence(new File(path));
String parse = MiderCodeTransfer.parseMidiSource(seq);
System.out.println(parse);
```

# Note
- if you parse a midi file that is not generated by mider, you might get a wired result, see known problems below.

# Known Problems
- note durations are not always correct when parsing complex midi files.
- controller parameter are not set correctly.
- note on events and note off events might not able to set when they are not paired.

### anyone is welcome to contribute for I have little time to fix it.

enjoy.
